# Ancestry Inference

## Introduction

In this project, I refer to "Scaling probabilistic models of genetic variation to millions of humans" and implement TeraStructure algorithm in R language.

## Data

- The genetics data is from Professor Can Yang of the Department of Mathematics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

- You can use `PLINK` to read plink BED/BIM/FAM formats.

  `PLINK 2.0`: <http://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/>

- You can also use the `genio` (GenIO = Genetics I/O) package which aims to facilitate reading and writing genetics data. It's more constrained, user-friendly, and efficient.
